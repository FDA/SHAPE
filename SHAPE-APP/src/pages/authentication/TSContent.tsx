        These Terms of Service (this “
        <strong>
          <em>Agreement</em>
        </strong>
        ”) set out the terms on which the National Organization for Rare
        Disorders, a registered 501(c)(3) charity organization, (“
        <strong>
          <em>NORD</em>
        </strong>
        ” “
        <strong>
          <em>we</em>
        </strong>
        ” or “
        <strong>
          <em>us</em>
        </strong>
        ”) or its licensors will provide access to and use of certain services
        which allow users to contribute information regarding symptoms,
        treatment and other experiences related to living with rare diseases,
        available on or through the [SHAPE] mobile application (the “
        <strong>
          <em>Service</em>
        </strong>
        ”) to you, a user of the Service (“
        <strong>
          <em>you</em>
        </strong>
        ” or “
        <strong>
          <em>User</em>
        </strong>
        ”). The [SHAPE] mobile application is owned by the U.S. Food and Drug
        Administration (“
        <strong>
          <em>FDA</em>
        </strong>
        ”) and licensed to NORD for the purpose described in Section 1(a) for
        the duration of the study (the “<em>Pilot Period</em>”).
      </p>

      <p>
        You should read this Agreement carefully. By indicating acceptance of
        this Agreement or by otherwise using the Service, you are entering into
        a legally binding agreement with us, and you hereby represent that you
        are of legal age, and are otherwise fully able and competent, to enter
        into a binding agreement. If you are using the Service on behalf of an
        organization, you represent that you have the right to bind such
        organization to this Agreement, and the terms “User” and “you” will
        include both you, the individual user, and such organization. If you do
        not agree to these terms and conditions, you must not use the Service.
      </p>

      <p>
        THIS AGREEMENT CREATES A BINDING LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND NORD,
        AND INCLUDES AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE UNDER WHICH CERTAIN CLAIMS MAY NOT BE
        BROUGHT IN COURT OR DECIDED BY A JURY. PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT
        CAREFULLY.
      </p>

      <p>1. Nature of the Service. </p>

      <p>
        a. <em>Data Collection Related to Rare Disorders</em>. NORD or its
        licensors will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the
        Service described in and subject to these Terms of Service during the
        Pilot Period. The Service allows individuals living with rare diseases
        to share data with NORD by participating in surveys and otherwise
        providing information related to their medical conditions (the “
        <strong>
          <em>User Data</em>
        </strong>
        ”). The use and sharing of User Data is governed by NORD’s Privacy
        Policy (as further explained below) and, as to an individual patient or
        caregiver utilizing the Service, by a specific informed consent
        document. We encourage you to review these documents thoroughly.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Disclaimer</em>. THE SERVICE IS NOT DESIGNED TO PROVIDE MEDICAL
        ADVICE OR FACILITATE MEDICAL EMERGENCIES. THE SERVICE IS NOT DESIGNED
        FOR USE IN DIAGNOSING MEDICAL CONDITIONS OR MAKING TREATMENT DECISIONS.
        ALWAYS SEEK THE ADVICE OF YOUR PHYSICIAN OR OTHER QUALIFIED HEALTH
        PROVIDER WITH ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE REGARDING YOUR HEALTH. NEVER
        DISREGARD PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL ADVICE OR DELAY IN SEEKING IT BECAUSE OF
        SOMETHING YOU HAVE READ ON THIS SITE. IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE A MEDICAL
        EMERGENCY, CALL YOUR DOCTOR OR 911 IMMEDIATELY. DO NOT RELY ON
        ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS OR COMMUNICATION THROUGH THE SERVICE FOR
        IMMEDIATE, URGENT MEDICAL NEEDS.
      </p>

      <p>
        b. <em>Health Care Providers</em>. You understand and agree that by
        using the Service, you are not entering into a health care
        provider-patient relationship with NORD. You understand that information
        you send or receive via the Service does not become part of your
        separate medical records held by your health care providers. The Service
        is not meant to keep a record of complete or exhaustive information
        about any individual User’s medical condition. You are strongly
        encouraged to consult with a qualified health care professional for
        answers to your personal questions.
      </p>

      <p>
        2. Registration. In order to use certain parts of the Service, you will
        be required to provide us information including, but not limited to,
        your first name, last name, date of birth, email address, and answers to
        non-identifying challenge questions, and to create a password and
        register with us. You will then be sent an ID number from us by e-mail.
        This ID number, but not your other registration information, will be
        shared by NORD with FDA. When you initially install the application on
        your mobile device, you will be required to provide the ID number along
        with the answers to the challenge questions, in order to complete the
        registration process. Once you have completed the registration process,
        you will be able to complete surveys and provide additional information
        regarding your medical history and condition to the Service. You
        represent, warrant and covenant to us that you will provide us with
        accurate, current and complete information. You are responsible for your
        registration, and for all use of the Service using any User credentials
        or passwords issued to you or chosen by you. You will keep all such
        credentials and passwords confidential.
      </p>

      <p>
        3. No Fee. Use of the Service is available free of charge during the
        Pilot Period.
      </p>

      <p>
        4. Your Representations and Warranties. You represent, warrant and
        covenant that: (a) you comply and will comply with all applicable laws
        and regulations in your use of the Service; and (b) all User Data and
        other information supplied by you to NORD, and NORD’s use thereof as
        described herein, do not and will not infringe the intellectual
        property, publicity, or privacy rights, or any other proprietary or
        contractual rights, of any third parties.
      </p>

      <p>5. Ownership Rights. </p>

      <p>
        a. <em>The Application</em>. The Service, including all aspects of the
        [SHAPE application], is the property of, and owned by, NORD or its
        licensors. As between you and NORD, all the software, algorithms,
        functionality, inventions, concepts, text, images, marks, logos,
        compilations, content and technology used to deliver the Service or
        otherwise embodied in, displayed through, or provided directly or
        indirectly (e.g., emails or other communications from us to you) via,
        the Service are “
        <strong>
          <em>Our Property</em>
        </strong>
        .” Except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Agreement, any use,
        copying, making derivative works, transmitting, posting, linking, deep
        linking, framing, redistribution, sale, decompilation, modification,
        reverse engineering, translation or disassembly of Our Property is
        prohibited. You acknowledge that Our Property has been created,
        compiled, developed and maintained by us or our licensors at great
        expense of time and money such that misappropriation or unauthorized
        disclosure or use of Our Property by others for commercial gain would
        unfairly and irreparably harm us in a manner for which damages would not
        be an adequate remedy, and you consent to our obtaining injunctive
        relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement,
        without any requirement to post bond. You may be subject to criminal or
        civil penalties for violation of this paragraph.
      </p>

      <p>
        b. <em>Our Marks</em>. The names and marks NORD and NATIONAL
        ORGANIZATION FOR RARE DISORDERS, and the names and marks of any
        sub-brands and variants of these marks, and any associated logos, are
        registered or unregistered trademarks or service marks of NORD or its
        licensors. You may not use them, or any of our other marks or logos, in
        any manner, including any use that is likely to cause confusion or that
        disparages or discredits us, without our consent. The Service may also
        feature the trademarks, service marks, and logos of third parties, and
        each owner retains all rights in such marks. Any use of such marks, or
        any others displayed on the Service, will inure solely to the benefit of
        their respective owners.
      </p>

      <p>
        Subject to the terms and conditions herein, we grant you the
        non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited, revocable right to access and
        use Our Property solely to the extent necessary for you to use the
        Service, as permitted by this Agreement, solely for your personal
        non-commercial use. We reserve all other rights. For clarity and without
        limiting other obligations herein, Users shall not distribute or
        otherwise commercialize Our Property.
      </p>

      <p>
        c. <em>User Data</em>. NORD shall exclusively own all right, title, and
        interest in and to the User Data. To the extent you acquire any rights
        in the User Data, you irrevocably assign and agree to assign to NORD all
        right, title and interest worldwide in and to the User Data. If you have
        or will have any rights in the User Data which are not assigned to NORD
        for any reason, you unconditionally and irrevocably grants and agree to
        grant to NORD an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable,
        perpetual, license to use, modify, reproduce, distribute, and create
        derivative works of the User Data. To the extent allowed by law, this
        Section 5(c) and any license granted to NORD hereunder includes all
        rights of paternity, integrity, disclosure and withdrawal and any other
        rights that may be known as or referred to as “moral rights,” “Creator’s
        rights,” “droit moral,” or the like. You may use your User Data to the
        extent necessary for you to use the Service, as permitted by this
        Agreement. NORD may disclose User Data that has been de-identified or
        aggregated to FDA. FDA or any entity directed by FDA may potentially use
        this data as an external control for a future clinical trial.
      </p>

      <p>
        6. Use of the Service. You must comply with all rules and policies about
        use of the Service in this Agreement and that we publish from time to
        time. These rules and policies will be available on the Service. Certain
        features, pages or content within the Service may contain supplemental
        terms of use, to which you must agree in order to use the relevant
        features, pages or content. You must not: (a) harvest or otherwise
        collect information about others from the Service; (b) take any action
        that imposes or may impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large
        load on the Service or its infrastructure, or bypass any measures we may
        use to prevent or restrict access to any portion of the Service (or
        other accounts, networks or services connected thereto); (c) use manual
        or automated software, devices, or other processes to “crawl”, “scrape”
        or “spider” any of the Service or otherwise to copy, obtain, propagate,
        distribute or misappropriate any information or other content from the
        Service, including any of Our Property; (d) distribute or otherwise make
        available any information or other content obtained through the Service
        to any third party, except as expressly permitted herein; (e) otherwise
        interfere in any manner with the use or operation of the Service; or (f)
        use the Service in the development, directly or indirectly, of any
        product, software or service that offers any functionality substantially
        similar to, or competitive with, the Service. We reserve the right (but
        are under no obligation) to investigate any claim that use of the
        Service does not conform to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
        and to terminate your use of the Service for breach of this Agreement.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        7. Feedback. If you provide to us (directly or indirectly, and by any
        means) any comments, feedback, suggestions, ideas, or other submissions
        related to the Service (collectively “
        <strong>
          <em>Feedback</em>
        </strong>
        ”), the Feedback will be the sole property of NORD. We will be entitled
        to use, reproduce, disclose, publish, distribute, and otherwise exploit
        in any manner, all Feedback, without restriction and without
        compensating you in any way. We are and shall be under no obligation to
        maintain any Feedback in confidence, or to respond to any Feedback.
      </p>

      <p>
        8. Warranty Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability. THE SERVICE IS
        PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITH ALL FAULTS. WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL
        WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING: (A) ALL WARRANTIES OF
        MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE,
        NONINFRINGEMENT, AND ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF
        DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE; AND (B) THAT THE SERVICE OR OUR PROPERTY WILL
        MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, WILL ALWAYS BE AVAILABLE, ACCESSIBLE,
        UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE OR OPERATE WITHOUT ERROR. WE DISCLAIM ALL

        PARTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS.
        UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL YOU BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER FROM US ANY
        INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE OR SPECIAL DAMAGES
        (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF USE), WHETHER BASED ON
        CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE ARISING FROM OR
        RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE SERVICE OR OUR PROPERTY, EVEN IF WE HAVE
        BEEN INFORMED OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
        TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, OUR MAXIMUM AGGREGATE
        LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS
        AGREEMENT, THE SERVICE OR OUR PROPERTY, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT
        (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT OF
        $10. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF
        WARRANTIES OR OF LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES, SO SOME OF THE
        ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
      </p>

      <p>
        9. Third Party Services. Without limitation of the disclaimers and
        limitations of liability set forth in Section 8, you acknowledge and
        agree that NORD provides the Service using third party service
        providers. NORD does not endorse, and hereby disclaims all liability or
        responsibility to you or any other person for, any third party services.
        We reserve the right to change the terms of any third party service
        provider relationship or terminate your access to the Service at any
        time upon notice to you due to a change necessitated by unforeseen
        circumstances that may arise after the date hereof, regulatory changes
        or changes imposed or required by a third party service provider.
      </p>

      <p>
        10. Indemnity. You will indemnify us, our affiliates, and our and their
        respective partners, members, trustees, directors, officers, employees,
        and licensors against any and all claims, actions, proceedings, suits,

        <strong>
          <em>Liabilities</em>
        </strong>
        ”) arising out of or related to (a) your breach of this Agreement or (b)
        your use of the Service (but excluding any Liabilities to the extent
        caused by our negligence or willful misconduct). We reserve the right to
        assume the sole control of the defense and settlement of any claim,
        action, suit or proceeding for which you are obliged to indemnify us.
        You will cooperate with us with respect to such defense and settlement.
      </p>

      <p>
        11. Our Privacy Policy. We operate the Service under the Privacy Policy
        published and available on the application’s landing page (the “
        <strong>

        ”), which is hereby incorporated into this Agreement. Each party shall
        comply with the Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <p>
        12. Suspension and Termination. This Agreement will terminate upon the
        expiration of the Pilot Period, unless it is earlier terminated by you
        or us as provided in this Section 12. You may terminate this Agreement

        Agreement.
      </p>

      <p>
        13. Modification of Service and Agreement. We reserve the right to
        modify the Service at any time, without notice to you. We may also from

      </p>

      <p>
        15. Applicable Law. You and we each agree that all disputes or other
        matters arising from or relating to this Agreement, or the use or
        operation of the Service, will be governed by the substantive laws of
        the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, U.S.A., without regard to its or any
        other jurisdiction’s conflicts of laws principles that would apply
        another law. Any action or proceeding by you relating to any claim
        arising from or relating to the Service or this Agreement must commence
        within the shorter of the applicable statute of limitations or one year
        after the cause of action has accrued. The United Nations Convention for
        the International Sale of Goods is hereby disclaimed.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        16. Arbitration. We will attempt to resolve disputes with Users to their
        satisfaction. If, however, a matter arises that cannot be resolved
        promptly between you and us, you agree that any disputes arising out of
        or relating to the Service or this Agreement (including the validity and
        scope of the agreement to arbitrate and any disputes with other users of
        the Service) shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding
        arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“
        <strong>
          <em>AAA</em>
        </strong>
        ”) under the Federal Arbitration Act, and shall be conducted before a
        single arbitrator pursuant to the applicable Rules and Procedures
        established by the AAA (for information on the AAA and its rules, see
        adr.org). You agree that the arbitration shall be held in Commonwealth
        of Massachusetts, U.S.A, unless the AAA or the arbitrator shall
        determine that venue in such city is unreasonably burdensome, in which
        case the AAA or the arbitrator shall select a venue that is not
        unreasonably burdensome to both you and us. You agree that, if the AAA
        shall be unavailable or decline to administer the arbitration, and the
        parties do not agree on a substitute, a substitute administrator or
        arbitrator shall be appointed by the court. The arbitrator may render
        early or summary disposition of some or all issues, after the parties
        have had a reasonable opportunity to make submissions on these issues.
        At NORD’s option, this provision shall not apply to claims of patent,
        trademark, or copyright infringement or misappropriation of trade
        secrets (collectively, “
        <strong>
          <em>IP Claims</em>
        </strong>
        ”). With respect to any IP Claims that are not subject to arbitration
        under the above provision, you hereby consent to non-exclusive
        jurisdiction and venue in any federal or state court located within the
        State of Connecticut, U.S.A., with respect to any suit, claim or cause
        of action arising from or relating to the Service or this Agreement, and
        you shall not bring any such suit, claim or cause of action except in a
        court located within the State of Connecticut, U.S.A. You agree that any
        arbitration shall not permit claims on a class, mass, representative, or
        private attorney general basis. You further agree that no claims of
        other parties may be consolidated with your or our claims in the
        arbitration without both your and our consent. YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR
        RIGHTS TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A
        CLASS, MASS, REPRESENTATIVE, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR CONSOLIDATED
        ACTION AGAINST US. If any part of this Arbitration clause is later
        deemed invalid as a matter of law, then it shall be severed and the
        remaining portions of this section shall remain in effect, with the
        exception that if the preceding paragraph is deemed invalid, then this
        entire section shall be deemed invalid and the arbitration clause shall
        be void.
      </p>

      <p>
        17. Force Majeure. NORD will not be liable for delay or non-performance
        of any of its obligations hereunder or its performance of the Service to
        the extent that such performance is prevented, prohibited or delayed by
        any circumstance for reasons beyond its control including without
        limitation, labor disputes, fire, flood, natural disaster, epidemic or
        pandemic, war, military operations, riot, civil commotion, plant
        breakdown, state of emergency, power outage, computer or other equipment
        failure or non-delivery or delays in delivery by any other suppliers of
        goods or services utilized in the performance of services under this
        Agreement, provided that NORD completes performance of the Service
        within a reasonable time after such circumstances are resolved.

        18. Geography. We provide the Service from the United States and for use
        only by persons located in the United States. We make no claims that the
        Service or any of its content is accessible or appropriate outside of
        the United States. Access to the Service may not be legal by certain
        persons or in certain countries. If you access the Service from outside
        the United States, you do so on your own initiative and are responsible
        for compliance with local laws.

        19. Miscellaneous Provisions. No delay or omission by us in exercising
        any of our rights occurring upon any noncompliance or default by you
        with respect to any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement will
        impair any such right or be construed to be a waiver thereof, and a
        waiver by us of any of the covenants, conditions or agreements to be
        performed by you will not be construed to be a waiver of any succeeding
        breach thereof or of any other covenant, condition or agreement herein.
        No waiver will be binding on us unless made in an express writing signed
        by us. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of
        competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then this
        Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will be reformed to
        be valid and enforceable while reflecting the intent of the parties to
        the greatest extent permitted by law. Except as otherwise expressly
        provided herein, this Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between
        us and you regarding its subject matter, and supersedes all prior
        promises, agreements or representations, whether written or oral,
        regarding such subject matter. Your registration, this Agreement and
        your rights and obligations hereunder are not assignable, or otherwise
        transferable or delegable, by you to any third party without our prior
        written consent in our sole discretion. Any purported assignment,
        transfer or delegation without such consent will be null and void. We
        may assign or otherwise transfer or delegate this Agreement (including
        any rights or obligations hereunder), including to any purchaser of our
        organization, from time-to-time in our sole discretion. This Agreement
        will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties’ successors
        and permitted assigns. You agree that the electronic text of this
        Agreement constitutes a writing and your assent to the terms and
        conditions hereof constitutes a “signing” for all purposes. As used
        herein and unless the intent is expressly otherwise in a specific
        instance, the terms “include,” “includes” or “including” shall not be
        limiting and “or” shall not be exclusive. Any section headings herein
        are for convenience only and do not form a part of, and will not be used
        in the interpretation of, the substantive provisions of this Agreement.
        You agree that email to your email address on record will constitute
        formal notice under this Agreement.{" "}
